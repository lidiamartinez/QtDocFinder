# qtdocfinder
A plugin for Sublime Text 3 that adds options in the selected text context menu (right click) for searching the selected text on different documentation sites for C++ Qt, PySide and PyQt. For Qt4 and Qt5.

It's not a very complex plugin. This will probably need updates since I'm using hardcoded urls, but it's useful to quickly search for documentation articles when you are developing a Qt gui on sublime.
